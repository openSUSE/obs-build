== Goals

== Design

The pbuild tool is a level above "the build script" called "build". "build" is handling single build jobs, while
pbuild is managing the dependencies between this build jobs. Both can get executed on any Linux system directly.

pbuild is processing local sources, but may download remote sources and binaries when referenced.
The local sources can get managed by any source revision management tool (eg. git).

The tasks of the build script are:
* Building a defined and reproducable environement for one build job
* Calling the build tool for any supported format (rpm, deb, kiwi image, docker, ...)
* Calling validations as provided by the build environement
* Extract build results
* Parse dependencies in binaries and build description files

The tasks of pbuild are:
* calculating the dependencies between the build jobs for a build order
* calculating the need of rebuilds due to changed sources or dependencies
* manage multiple running build jobs in the background
* organize build results on the disk
* download remote assets (sources or binaries)

=== Filesystem Structure

pbuild expects to get call in a directory where it's project configuration files are living. Package sources
live in directories inside of this project directory:

* Top directory
** Package A
*** source files
** Package B
*** source files
** ...
** _pbuild
** _config
** _build.<preset>
*** _jobhistory
*** Package A results
**** Build results
*** Package B results
**** Build results
*** .pbuild

==== _config

Can define build configurations. Usually defaults from a distribution are used, but this file can provide
additional rules. These define which packages need to become available in the build environment, macro definitions
and many more. See the build config topic for a detailed list.

==== _pbuild

This file defines one or more presets. A preset defines which 

* distribution configuration
* repositories
* hardware architectures

==== _build.<preset>

contains all binaries for the given preset. These are either downloaded or build local. Additional underscore prefixed 
files contain informations about the build history and current states of the build.

=== Important Options

pbuild does not need any parameters by default. It will build inside of KVM by default which can work
as user (non-root) in a proper environment. KVM will also ensure that the correct kernel is running
during build. However, builds in chroot or containern is also possible via

 --vm-type=chroot
 --vm-type=docker

Define the amount of provided memory in KVM via

 --vm-memory=MEGABYTES

The build environment disk space can get defined via

 --vm-disk-size=MEGABYTES

The KVM is fully isolated by default. This ensures that the build can become fully reproducibile and
also that no attack by using untrusted sources or binaries can happen. However, one may want to
use remote resources during build. In that case network access can get enabled via

 --vm-network

Keep in mind that this can get usually avoided by using remote assets instead.

=== Important Debugging Options

pbuild always creates a consistent state. That means it may not build actually anything, when the
last build result look current. One can enforce a rebuild by using:

  --rebuild <PACKAGE>

The build log is by default only stored on disk. The live build log can be made available by 
using the

  --showlog

option. If you want to debug a problem with a single package, you can use the

  --single <PACKAGE>

option to make pbuild only look at the specified package. This also triggers an rebuild
of the package. It often makes sense to use

  --single <PACKAGE> --shell-after-fail

to get a shell prompt in case a build failure occurs. 

Alternatively, one can reuse last build enviroment or create a new one by using the

  --shell

option. This will give a prompt after the environment has been initialized.

Extra packages needed for debugging can be specified with

  -x binary_package

(eg. gdb, strace, valgrind or assumed missing dependencies for testing).

=== Remote Assets

Remote Assets can be defined inside of the build descriptions. They are resources from a remote
servers and will be downloaded and validated by pbuild before the corresponding build is started.

Supported protocols for resources using an url are:

 * http
 * https
 * git+http
 * git+https

This depends on the build description format as described below.

==== rpm spec files

Source lines in spec files can declare remote assets. Rpm is already supporting to use
an URL as source definition. A comment before such a line marks it as remote asset for pbuild:

 #!RemoteAsset
 Source: <URL>

It is also possible to specify a checksum to make sure that the asset is correct.

 #!RemoteAsset: <CHECKSUM>
 Source: <URL>

An alternative is to use the 

 #!RemoteAssetUrl: <URL>

marker if the downloaded file should not become part of the source rpm.

==== kiwi build description

The kiwi format is not supporting remote source specifications, but they can be specified via XML
comments.

  <!-- OBS-RemoteAsset: <URL> -->

The resulting download file can be copied into the image using

  <!-- OBS-CopyToImage: <source> <destination> -->


==== Arch Linux PKGBUILD

PKGBuild files already contain the needed URLs and Checksums, so no extra
treatment is needed.

==== FedPkg "sources" file

The sources file contains a list of file names with checksums. PBuild will
automatically download the missing files from a FedPkg Server that needs
to be configured in the project config via the "AssetsURL:" directive or set
with the "--assets" option.
