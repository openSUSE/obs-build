.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbuild\fR is a tool to build binary packages in a safe and reproducible
way.
The default is to build in a chroot sandbox, but \fBbuild\fP also supports
building in a virtual machine for better security.
.P
If a recipe file is specified on the command line,
.B build
will use this file and all other files in the directory for building
the package. If no recipe argument is provided, build will search the
current directory for a file.
.P
The
.B build
tool understands the following recipe file types:
.TP
.B spec
A specfile used to generate rpms.
.TP
.B src.rpm
A source rpm, which will be unpacked for the build.
.TP
.B kiwi
A kiwi config file used to generate a kiwi image.
.TP
.B dsc
A dsc file used to generate Debian binary packages.
.TP
.B PKGBUILD
A file used to generate Arch Linux binary packages.
.TP
.B build.collax
A shell script used to generate a Collax binary package.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --clean
Remove the build system and reinitialize it from scratch.
.TP
.B --no-init
Skip the build system initialization and start with build immediately.
.TP
.BI "\-\-repo " dir_or_url
Either a directory containing binary packages (optionally with repository
metadata), or a url pointing to some remote repository. Multiple
\fB--repo\fP options can be used so create a specific repository
layering. Note that packages are searched in the specified repository
order, i.e. the first repository containing a package with a specific
name wins regardless of the version.
As a special form, 'zypp://reponame' can be used to specify
a system repository. 'zypp://' selects all enabled system
repositories. This is also the default if BUILD_RPMS is not
set and no \fB--rpms\fP or \fB--repo\fP option is used.
.TP
.BI "\-\-dist " distribution
Set the distribution. If this option is not given, build tries to
guess the distribution by looking at the available packages.
The specified distribution can either be a string
like "11.2" or "sles9", "debian7", or the pathname of the build
configuration to use.
.TP
.BI "\-\-root " buildroot
Specifies where the build system is set up. Overrides the
BUILD_ROOT enviroment variable.
.TP
.B --help
Print a short help text.
.TP
.B --norootforbuild
Force building with user \fRabuild\fP. Otherwise, \fBbuild\fP searches
the recipe file for a "needsrootforbuild" hint to decide what user
to use.
.TP
.B --list-state
list packages that would be used to create a fresh build root.
Does not create the build root or perform a build.
.TP
.BI "\-\-rpms " path1 : path2 : path3\fR...\fP
Where build can find the packages needed to create the
build system. This option overrides the BUILD_RPMS environment
variable. This option is deprecated, use \fB--repo\fP instead.
.TP
.BI "\-\-arch " arch1 : arch2 : arch3\fR...\fP
What architectures to select from the RPMs.
.B build
automatically sets this to a sensible value for your host if you
do not specify this option so you should almost never need it.

.SH RPM BUILD SPECIFIC OPTIONS
.TP
.B --useusedforbuild
Tell build not to do dependency expansion, but to extract the
list of packages to install from "# usedforbuild" lines or, if none
are found, from all "BuildRequires" lines.  This option is useful
if you want to re-build a package from a srcrpm with exactly the
same packages used for the srcrpm build.
.TP
.B --stage
Pass a stage option to rpmbuild. The default is \fB-ba\fP.
.TP
.B --target
Call rpmbuild with a target option. This can be used for cross building.
.TP
.B --verify
Verify the files in an existing build system.

.SH VIRTUAL MACHINE SPECIFIC OPTIONS
.TP
.B "--xen --kvm --uml --qemu --emulator --zvm --lxc"
Sets a specific vm type.
.TP
.BI "--vm-type " type
As above.
.TP
.BI "--vm-disk " file
Specifies the location of the disk image to use. If this option is not
given, \fIbuildroot\fP\fB.img\fP is used (e.g. /var/tmp/build-root.img).
.TP
.BI "--vm-disk-size " size_in_mb
Specify the size of the disk image to create.
.TP
.BI "--vm-disk-filesystem " type
Sets the filesystem type to use when creating the disk image. The default
is to use the ext3 filesystem.
.TP
.BI "--vm-swap " file
Specifies the location of the swap file to use. If this option is not
given, \fIbuildroot\fP\fB.swap\fP is used (e.g. /var/tmp/build-root.swap).
.TP
.BI "--vm-swap-size " size_in_mb
Specify the size of the swap file to create.
.TP
.BI "--vm-memory " size_in_mb
Sets the desired memory size of the virtual machine.
.TP
.BI "--vm-kernel " kernel_file
Set a specific kernel to boot in the virtual machine.
.TP
.BI "--vm-initrd " initrd_file
Set a specific kernel to boot in the virtual machine.
.TP
.B --vm-disk-clean
Force the recreation of the disk image.

.SH RECIPE FILE OPTIONS
The
.B build
command interprets some special control comments in the recipe file:
.TP
.B # norootforbuild
.TQ
.B # needsrootforbuild
.B build
uses either user
.I root
or user
.I abuild
in the build system to do the build.  For non-SUSE distros as well as
since SUSE 10.2, the default build user is
.I abuild.
For 10.2 and before, the default build user is
.I root.
These two flags in the spec file allow to deviate from the defaults
and force-set the build user to
.I abuild
and
.I root
.RI "(for " "#\ norootforbuild" " and " "#\ needsrootforbuild" " respectively."
.TP
.B # needsbinariesforbuild
provide the binary rpms that have been used to set up the build root
in
.I /.build.binaries
within the build root.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B BUILD_ROOT
The directory where build should install the chrooted build system.
"/var/tmp/build-root" is used by default. See the \fB--root\fP option.
.TP
.B BUILD_RPMS
This can be used instead of the \fB--rpms\fP option. Deprecated.
.TP
.B BUILD_RPM_BUILD_STAGE
The rpm build stage (-ba, -bb, ...).  This is just passed through to
rpm, check the rpm manpage for a complete list and descriptions.
"-ba" is the default. You should probably use the \fB--stage\fP
option instead.
