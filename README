This is a tool to build binary packages in a safe and reproducible
way. The default is to build in a chroot sandbox, but it also
supports building in a virtual machine for better security.

The build tool can work with multiple package and recipe formats.
The currently supported package formats are deb, rpm, and arch.
The supported recipe formats are spec, dsc, kiwi, and PKGBUILD.

See the man page for more information.
