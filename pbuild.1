.SH DESCRIPTION
The pbuild tool builds a project consisting of a set of packages stored
in the specified directory \fIdir\fP. If the directory is not specified,
the current working directory is used instead.

A package consists of files stored in a directory where the package name is
the name of the directory. Directories with names starting with "." or "_"
are ignored.

Pbuild works by parsing the recipe files from the packages to get dependency
information, sorting the packages by dependency and then creating build
jobs for every package that needs to be rebuild. Pbuild stores extra
information with the build results so that it is able to resume after
interruption or integrate new source changes.

The results of the package builds are stored in a directory
"\fB_result.\fP\fIreponame\fP\fB.\fP\fIarch\fP", where \fIreponame\fP
defaults to the name of the base distribution selected with the
--dist or --preset options.

.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-\-arch " arch
Build for the specified architecture. If this option is not used, pbuild
will build for the host architecture.
.TP
.BI "\-\-preset " preset
Use a defined preset to set the distribution config, the repositories,
and the container registries. Presets can be defined by having a "_pbuild"
file in the source directory.
.TP
.BI "\-\-dist " dist
Use the specified distribution config \fIdist\fP to configure the build
environment.
.TP
.BI "\-\-reponame " name
Use the specified name to generate the directory name used to store the
package build results.

.SH BUILD OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-\-repo " url
Use the specified location to set up the build environment. The repo
option can be used multiple times to create a search path. Note that
the order of the option matters, i.e. the first repository containing a
package with a specific name wins regardless of the version. If no
repo is configured, the default repositories specified in the
distribution config is used.
.TP
.BI "\-\-registry " url
Use the specified location to search for remote containers.
.TP
.BI "\-\-obs " url
Use the specified url to specify the open build service instance if
obs:/ urls need to be resolved.
.TP
.BI "\-\-buildjobs " num
Start up to \fInum\fP processes to build packages in parallel.
.TP
.BI "\-\-rebuild-pkg " packagename
Force a rebuild of the specified package. This option can be
used multiple times.
.TP
.BI "\-\-rebuild-code " code
Force a rebuild of the packages in state "code". This option can be
used multiple times.
.TP
.BI "\-\-rebuild " \fR[\fPcode_or_packagename\fR]\fP
Short hand form to force a rebuild. If no argument is given,
all packages are rebuilt. If the argument is a known
result code, packages with a state matching the specified code are rebuilt.
Otherwise it is assumed that the argument is a package name.
.TP
.B "\-\-vm-..."
.PD 0
.TP
.B "\-\-jobs"
.TP
.B "\-\-threads"
.TP
.B "\-\-xen, \-\-kvm, ..."
.TP
.B "\-\-no-checks"
.TP
.B "\-\-no-clean"
.TP
.B "\-\-target"
.PD
This options are passed on to the call of the build tool used to build
packages.

.SH QUERY OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-\-result-pkg " packagename
Only show build results for the specified package. This option can be
used multiple times.
.TP
.BI "\-\-result-code " code
Only show build results for builds that resulted in the specified code.
This option can be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI "\-\-result " \fR[\fPcode_or_packagename\fR]\fP
This is a short hand form for result querying. If no argument is given,
the results for all packages are shown. If the argument is a known
result code, builds that resulted in the specified code are shown.
Otherwise it is assumed that the argument is a package name.
.TP
.B "\-\-terse"
Do not show detailed information about the package state.

.SH MISC OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-\-hostarch " arch
Assume the specified host architecture instead of using "uname -m".
.TP
.BI "\-\-configdir " dir
Specify a different directory containing distribution configurations.
.TP
.BI "\-\-help"
Print a short help text.

.SH RETURN CODES
.TP
.BI 0
When none of the builds finished with failure, unresolvable or in broken state
.TP
.BI 1
When one or more builds failed, remained unresolvable or in broken state
